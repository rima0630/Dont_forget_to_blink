# Dont_forget_to_blink
A Raspberry Pi-based project I worked on that reminds the user to blink often, preventing them from straining their eyes. Not in an annoying way at all! :)

You will definitely need to spend some time installing some libraries! These include OpenCV, dlib, numpy, scipy, imutils and many more!

Check out this blog post for instructions on how to install the libraries you will need for this project:

This project was made to work on a Raspberry Pi, so there are also a few other things you may need to tweak in the source code to make this work for your needs. I encourage you to check out the comments in the code and spend time understanding how it works. The above link will serve as a great help for this too. 

For mapping the facial features, a .dat file will be needed, which you can find here in this google drive link. It is too big to upload to github. Just make sure this file is in the same directory as detect_blinks.py

Have fun! :)
